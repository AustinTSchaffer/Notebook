## Resources Used for this Certification

Below is a list of the resources that I used to complete this exam, along with some of the costs associated with those resources.

I spent $30 for the ["AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Practice Exams" course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c02). This course contains 6 practice exams with over 60 questions each. I worked through an exam without studying to check my baseline understanding of the material. I then went back through all of the practice questions, recording the prompt and the correct answer, writing notes on all the topics presented in each question.

I spent ~2 hours taking a practice tests.

I wrote/transcribed/copied approximately 9000 words on one of the practice exams, which took up close to 4 afternoons.

I wrote/transcribed/copied notes on a second practice exam, taking about a work-day.
