# Linux Kiosks

It's possible to run a Linux distro (be it Ubuntu or Raspbian or Debian) in what is sometimes referred to as "Kiosk Mode". In this mode, the OS loads up an application instead of the desktop environment, allowing you to create a "boot to ready" experience for a single app. Could be useful if I ever want to set up a dedicated, wall-mount, whole-home media controller for Spotify, or a dedicated Plex client, or something like that. Probably a waste of a device, but it sounds cool on paper.

Example on the Ubuntu docs: https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/secure-ubuntu-kiosk#1-overview
