# Rosegarden

https://www.rosegardenmusic.com/

Rosegarden is the first FOSS program for Linux that I installed for messing around with MIDI in a serious capacity.

I spent a great deal of time building and installing it from source, but you can just install it with `apt install rosegarden` on systems that use APT. I won't go into how I compiled it from source, but here's a list of packages that I installed as a result of all that.

- cmake
- qtbase5-dev
- qttools5-dev
- ladspa-sdk
- dssi-dev
- liblo-dev
- liblrdf-dev
- libfftw3-dev
- libsamplerate-dev
- libsndfile1-dev
