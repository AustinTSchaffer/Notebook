# Common UX Mistakes

## 1. Crowded Screens

Violate several design principles
- inattentional blindness
    - principle stems from the way human visual system works
    - High-res imagery only comes from an arc the size of a quarter at arms length
- preference for openness
- Cognitive load
- Horror vacui (emotional response to crowded screens)

Users see what they expect to see. Their brains "filter" the images of the crowded screens on the fly so they only process what they're looking for. If you know what users need to see, you can speed them up and reduce their stress just by showing them what they need to see.

Alt Designs:

- Hub and Spoke
- Linear flow
- Expand / Collapse

## 2. Bad Signaling

- Labels look like entry fields (and vice versa)
- Bad colors
- Labels that look like buttons
- Buttons that are not obviously buttons

Better signalling can also be achieved with better icons, relative sizes, appropriately sized headers, appropriate groupings.

## 3. No Indication of Information Importance

Emphasize importance with size, color, and position (and shape).

## 4. Lack of Visual Cues

Transparent backgrounds, with symbols indicating purpose.

## 5. Too Many Data Grids

No comment.

Try out:

- Add symbols to data grids (leftmost column)
- ListBoxes (with filtering and sorting controls) 
- Timeline views for data where date-sequences are important

## 6. Too Many Options

Hick's Law: Time required to locate and use an option increases as the number of options increases.

- Favorites
- Recently Used
- Frequently used list
- Role-based menus
- Configurable menus
- make available actions context dependent
- filter to narrow down items
- OS-style search
- reorg with a wizard
- voice commands
- predictive menus
- hotkeys and shortcuts
- talk based searching
- menu item heatmap
- Jumplist

> Windows 8 failed in part because it was too hard to find different apps. Tried to satisfy too many people and satisfied none of them.

# 7. Bad search experience

Classic searching is designed out of the convenience for the developer.

You're going to spend a lot of time designing searches.

# 8. UI is too Static

Improvements:

- Sizing to different users/hardware
- Editing different data types
- Phases of a process
- Dashboards
- Allow users to configure the UI

## Honorable Mentions

- Keeping obsolete, clunky designs for "consistency"
- Garish colors
- Design by accretion
    - aka Design-by-backlog
- Lack of mapping to real world

## Misc Notes

- If color is an important (useful) indicator, make sure you also vary the hue
- Try to make functional pictures of the real-life analogs
