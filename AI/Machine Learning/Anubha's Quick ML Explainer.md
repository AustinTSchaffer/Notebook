# Anubha's Quick ML Explainer

Machine Learning is more than just piles of linear algebra.

> I'd suggest taking a step back and first thinking about the problem you're trying to solve. Sometimes simpler models like logistic/linear regressions or decision tree based methods (xgboost has been hot for a minute) will work well. If you need to be able to explain your model output, the algorithm list cuts down significantly.

Deep Learning / Neural Nets can be overkill in most applications.
- NLP, voice, image type data may still work best for NNs/DL.
- for autonomous vehicles and robots, you'll also want Reinforcement Learning (RL).
- the rest of ML actually performs fairly well for all other use cases where you're dealing with numerical or categorical data

The whole idea behind Reinforcement Learning (RL) is
- there is the machine is trained based on a risk/reward system
- markov chains as such
