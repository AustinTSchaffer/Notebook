## Streetlights Project

https://www.codeforcville.org/cville-streetlights

> About the Streetlights project:  Streetlights increase safety and evening economic activity while being major users of electricity and contributing to the community's carbon footprint.  Choosing the right network of streetlights helps balance these trade-offs, but to consider the whole city, geospatial asset management tools that incorporate infrastructure, population, and environmental data are needed.
>
> Skills needed: Folks with skills in engineering cost estimation, software development, geospatial data and interoperability expertise, user experience (UI/UX), and laypersons who would be willing to test our designs and try to break them are all needed!

## The Shop

https://www.codeforcville.org/the-shop

> The Shop is a pro-bono IT consulting and problem-solving service for nonprofit organizations in Charlottesville and Central Virginia. We assign small groups of volunteers to work directly with someone at a nonprofit to solve a specific issue with tech, data, or web design.

## Criminal Record Expungement

> In Virginia, getting charged with a crime (not convicted) leads to a criminal record that pops up on background checks. That keeps people from jobs, housing, and loans. Some records are expungeable - hiding the records from these background checks. The state legislature is about to pass a new law expanding what is expungeable. The Legal Aid Justice Center (LAJC) wants to look at the public data on court cases to find how many records exist that are expungeable, how they break down by race and region, and answer other questions.
