- Agnostic about industry
- have a lot of contacts with
	- Norfolk Southern
	- Home Depot
	- Visa
	- Amazon Robotics
	- ManTech
	- T-Mobile
	- etc
- Elements to startup success
	- customer discovery
	- know yourself
	- lean methodology
- Customer discovery - "How many potential customers have you talked to?"
	- Be obsessed with the problem. It's not about the product, it's about the problem.
	- Get out and talk. You have to go talk to people. You won't make a business in a vacuum.
	- Feedback loop never ends. Customer discovery never really ends.
- Know thyself
	- product - founder - fit. Follow the purpose.
	- What's your journey? Where do you want your company/life to go?
	- This slide definitely felt like the speaker was trying to motivate everyone in the audience to found a startup based out of ATDC.
