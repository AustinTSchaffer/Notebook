# Music as Discovery
*How Generative AI May Impact Our View of Creativity by **Maritza Mills***

## Creations vs Discoveries
- Creations
	- Songs
	- Stories
	- Paintings
	- Architecture
	- Choreography
	- Inventions
- Discoveries
	- Species
	- Planets
	- Elements
	- Medicine
	- Math

## Why does the distinction matter?
- Discovery presupposes that the object of discovery already exists but was previously unknown.
- Creation implies that the object of creation has never existed before
- We hold different attitudes towards ownership when something is created vs when it is discovered
- Consider ownership questions surrounding intellectual property rights

## Historical Perspectives
- separation between creativity and the arts
- Artists were seen as craftsmen, attempting to emulate nature, which was perfect
- Divine inspiration
- Humans are intentional creators

## Modern Perspectives
- uniqueness
	- local / psychological (first time?)
	- historical (first time \[for everybody\]?)
- value
	- desirable
	- appropriate
- intentionality
	- purposeful
	- goal-directed
- cognition
	- individual
	- distributed

## Model Evaluation
- Sequence generation and styling
- Tools used
	- MusicVAE: 
	- GooVAE: 
	- GANSynth: 
- Trained on 300k musical notes, 1100 MINI drum samples

- `.mid` file
- MINI to JSON converter tool
- `.json` file
- Extract features

## What does this mean for us?
- Musicians are OVER.
- Some aspects of artistic creativity may become more akin to discovery
- Historical creativity becomes less important, local creativity becomes more relevant
- AI agents as content creators, curators, and judges of value
- Distributed cognition in generative AI as a model for rethinking creative ownership among people
- Should AI generated music automatically be considered part of the public domain?

## Q&A
- From songwriter's perspective, what's their opinion on going through the process of discovering the perfect melody?
	- Mixed reactions from professional musicians
	- To some, it doesn't feel like art.
	- To others, could be a useful tool to spur additional creativity.
- Google Research AI generated music guided by text. What do you think?
	- https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/
	- They hadn't heard about this.
