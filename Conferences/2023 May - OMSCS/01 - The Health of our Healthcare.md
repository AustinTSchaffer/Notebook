# The Health of our Healthcare
*AI and Software Disrupt Another Industry by **Pransu Dash***

> Our healthcare system is broken.

> - Everyone in SV (specifically people in digital health startups)

## A small walk down history

- 1897: Probably the first medical diagnosis over the telephone
- 1972: The first EMR system is developed (**Regenstreif Institute**)
- 2007: Fitbit exists
- 2018: American Medical Association (AMA) publishes its own policy on AI
- 2023: LLMs exist (OpenAI, Google Bard), and can pass medical licensing exams.

> Q: Why bring up all these events? Why are we talking about healthcare in general?
>
> A: It's an industry that isn't touched by software nearly as much as other industries.

## Is digitalization the way to fix healthcare?

- Are we improving patient outcomes?
- Do we serve as an aid to humans, not as a replacement?
- Is healthcare maintaining highest levels of equitability and accessibility?
- How trusting are providers and patients?

> Working in healthcare is hard, but that's a good thing.
1. The US healthcare market is 5x the size of the global marketing industry.
2. Healthcare is highly regulated.
3. Unlike Uber/AirBnb, the healthcare market is well defined, and it's never going away.

## Aspects of healthcare

### Management and Administration
- privacy in medical records
- revenue cycle management
- improving patient outcomes
- healthcare law and regulations

### Biotechnology
- new treatments with scientific bases
- distribution of new tech
- IoT devices
- improving patient outcomes

### Telemedicine
- has been around since 18-something
- cloud adoption
- improving patient outcomes

### Remote Patient Monitoring
- augmented intelligence
- accessible to most people?
- Accuracy and trust?
- improving patient outcomes

### Medicine Practice
- Can LLMs be replacements for human knowledge?
- improving patient outcomes

## Summary
- Software *can* improve patient outcomes.
- We *can* act as an aid to humans, without replacing them with technology.
- How do we maintain equitability and accessibility?
- How do we foster trust?

## Q&A
- improving patient outcomes comes in many forms
	- success metrics. Are you completely healed? Are you getting better? Tracked over time. Correlated with insurance benefits. Insurance companies take notice if you're not getting better.
- Covid was a catalyst for the widespread adoption of telemedicine. What are the future catalysts?
	- Telehealth itself might be a catalyst.
	- Insurance companies have developed a separate framework for reimbursing and thinking about telemedicine.
	- Billing management is one of the newer places where software can make a difference, because it opens up telehealth capabilities to smaller practicies
- US regulations can't keep up with the pace of new technology. Do any countries do it better? Who knows.
- Cloud adoption in telehealth. Using AWS/Azure to collect patient data? Use that data to generate prognosis as a proactive measure?
	- Bigger cloud companies esp Google have been putting a lot of research into collection patient data (classic)
	- Interoperable data schemas
	- Having this data in the cloud paves the way for proactive measures.
	- There are a few startups in this space.
- Concerns with privacy issues wrt the previous questions?
	- Def.
	- Security is very important.
	- There is a lot of research into privacy in telehealth
- FIRE standard. HL7 standard. There are data standard in healthcare. There's so many standards. One or two might standout above the others.
- Where do you see future revenue streams? Think 23andMe. Next billion dollar company?
- Online question, what kind of research do you (Pransu Dash) do?
	- How to make frameworks that focus on patient outcomes?
	- Patient history and data modelling.
	- FIRE and HL7 have existing for a long time but they're not data warehouse -adjacent technologies
	- There's so much we can learn just from the genome
