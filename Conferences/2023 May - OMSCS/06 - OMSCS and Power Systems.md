# OMSCS and Power Systems
*Bringing Two Worlds Together by **Alejandro Duque***

> Lead Power Systems Analytics Engineer

- power systems bring electricity from where it is made (generation to where it is consumed (demand) via transmission and distribution facilities (network)
- There are a few fundamental rules
	- Generation must equal demand at all points in time
	- Networks must be operated within strict safety limits often called Grid Congestion
- Power systems have changed dramatically in the last 20 years
	- Renewables: Wind, solar, etc
	- Transmission
	- Distribution: DER, smart networks, smart metering
	- Policies and regulation: incentivizing desired behaviors

> There is no transition \[to renewables\] without transmission.

**Power systems need software experts**

Closing the gap - OMSCS
- Automation
	- Selenium to automate previously manual tasks
- Reproducibility
	- trojan horse meme
	- Accessible and secure data storage
	- documentation
	- automate as much as you can
	- use version control as much as possible
	- Create Case -> Run Simulation -> Process Output -> Report
- Cloud
	- Web App (User)
	- Cloud App (Coordinator)
	- IO Handling (Data)
	- Worker Farm (Serverless Architecture)
	- Queues everywhere
- Digital Twins and CI/CD

Most useful course(s) he took in OMSCS:
- Software Development Processes (SDP)
- Cybersecurity
- Model and Data Analysis
