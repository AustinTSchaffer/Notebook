*Lessons from the Remote Confines of a Simulated NASA Spacecraft by **Russ Klvacek***

Over the summer of 2022, took part in a NASA simulated spacecraft. "NASA Analog Mission." Isolation and confinement for 45 days.

## About the Speaker
- OMSCS Grad, Summer 2020
- TA for ISyE
- etc

## HERA Overview
- Human Exploration Research Analog
- HRP: Human Research Program
- 5 elements
- Simulated environments to study psychological and physiological effects of long-duration spaceflight
- Spacecraft was 650 sqft
- Entered in May, exited in July

## What's the Analogy? (between HERA and OMSCS)
- Comms delay
- Supported by "mission control"

## Mindfulness and Rigor
- communication mastery is almost always understated
- "I used kind words and described the problem" vs "challenge every word, point, and topic"
- Honed, rigorous comms and diplomacy is what made the difference for 12 selected astronaut candidates of 12,000 applicants

## Be Specific
- compose pointed relevant messages
- send multiple separate messages to improve topic clarity
- Have I included images, video, or attachments at every possible juncture?
- Do my specific words attach to a context that the recipient understands?

## Be Thorough
- There's no such thing as too much communication (unless the communication is irrelevant to the issue/problem).
- Include all the information UP FRONT. Don't say "hey I have a problem" say "hey I have a problem and here's what I see and here's what I've tried"

## Be Consistent
- Establish and use standard terminology!
- Preamble your message with a lexicon to setup your points
- Monitor and reply reliably to messages. This "metadata" on your communication style can affect the whole conversation

## Employ a Team Mindset
- At the end of the day, everyone is trying to accomplish the same goal.

## Review, Revise, Reset
- Pause before sending your message, come back later
- Make changes to your tone and wording. It's unlikely that you got it right the first time!
- Reset to be agnostic to your problem or context.
	- If you were a TA or fellow student, would your word choice or tone come across as intended?
	- How might someone who disagrees with your perspective view your message?

## Keep Time on Your Side
- Triage! Can work be done in parallel?
- If you send incomplete info, will that help or hinder?
- Work the critical path. Life support is more critical than science results. Exams are more important than assignments.

## Be Basic
> Advice from Victor Glover, ISS astronaut

- "Share and play nice."
- Use the buddy system. Be a good buddy to yourself and others
- Avoid politicking
- "Know when to speak up and when to shut up."

## Join the next crew!
- NASA recruits new astronaut like crews for HERA and other analogs on a regular basis!

# Q&A
- How to remain calm when it gets stressful?
	- OMSCS has points of higher stress when comms breakdown
	- How do NASA astronauts handle this?
	- The crew needs to be respectful of each other's free time.
	- Support system.
