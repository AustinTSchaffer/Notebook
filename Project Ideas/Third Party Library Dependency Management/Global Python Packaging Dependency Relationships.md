	- "Current package managers only provide a local view of the dependency relationship"
	- "In this paper we present our research that target to bridge this gap: we propose a graph method to establish entire distribution package dependency relationship and analyze the complicated relationship graph with relevant properties."
	- Global view was for Ubuntu Kylin 14.04
