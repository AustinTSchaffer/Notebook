# Monte-Carlo Simulation of "Luck be a Landlord"

- Simulate games
    - determine profit of each item and each symbol

- select symbols in between spins
    - how does rarity come into play?
    - 
- persist all game data to a database. Keep track of:
    - profit of each symbol (on each turn)
    - profit of each item (on each turn)
    - turn destroyed (destroyed by)
    - any special actions of that symbol
- Make some graphs

Other ideas

Given a state, and either the respin/swap items, determine the best column/symbols to respin/swap, statistically (or just output the average/variance). How does game work when both are active?
