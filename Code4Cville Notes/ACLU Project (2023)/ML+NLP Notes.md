Essentially our steps will look like:
- remove stop words/punctuation
- decide if you want lemmatization/stemming
- vectorize/tf-idf for ngrams and visuals.
- then your ML will look like usual..
	- take the vectors and create feature
	- take your labeled data
	- split into train/test
	- etc etc

> hardest part in NLP sometimes is the first few steps since they can significantly change the output
