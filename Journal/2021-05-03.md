Prompts and responses to an online quiz related to HTTP, 

## HTTP GET Communication Flow

> Diagram the communication flow of an HTTP GET request from the browser to an application server and back. In this scenario, the application has a load balancer associated with the public DNS name, the load balancer performs SSL termination. Behind the load balancer are two web servers - each web server has nginx as an HTTP proxy and then an application server behind each nginx web proxy.

The HTTP response traffic from the application has to flow back through first Nginx, then the load balancer. In the case of the load balancer, the client connected to the load balancer (via its IP address, which it got from the site's domain name), so the client expects the response to come through the TCP connection it has with the load balancer. The same thing happens between the load balancer and Nginx on the application server, except the HTTP request between Nginx and the application is internal to the application server.

I did not depict in the diagram anything related to DNS. There's a whole network flow related to that as well. I really enjoyed this video by Computerphile on how all of that works: https://youtu.be/uOfonONtIuk

## HTTP Cookies

> Describe how HTTP Cookies work from an HTTP protocol perspective - how are they set? When does the browser send a cookie back to the server?

A web browser will save a cookie when an HTTP response contains a "Set-Cookie" header. This header has a lot of options that allow the server to specify parameters for the cookie, related to lifespan, which domain the cookie applies to, whether it's a secure cookie, etc. Documentation for this header: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie

When a web browser makes an HTTP request to a domain/endpoint, it will include all cookies that are relevant to that domain/endpoint using a "Cookie" header. Cookies are sent in a semicolon-separated list, with individual cookies being formatted "name=value". The server will then be able to read those cookies, and subsequently determine a relevant response for who its dealing with. Documentation for the Cookie header: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cookie

There are a lot of protections in place around how cookies are stored and how they can be accessed, especially since they are commonly used for session-based authentication.

## Debugging HTTP Traffic

> How do you debug problems with HTTP traffic when you encounter them? 

I recently had to set up HTTPS for an application server that was hosting a Jupyterhub instance. The application server VM instance was not behind a load balancer. The first thing I had to do was make sure that the domain name for the server was pointing to a public, static IP address, which required some configuration in Oracle Cloud (OCI) to set up a static IP for the VM instance, and communication with the admin for the domain name to update the DNS record in GoDaddy. I then generated a certificate using Certbot (Let's Encrypt), and set up Nginx on the application server so I could terminate SSL and proxy the application. Luckily Jupyterhub provides almost exactly what you need for the Nginx config for this setup.

It wasn't working yet, so I flushed my DNS cache and used ping/dig to make sure that the DNS record was updated and that my client had those changes. Once verified, I checked ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) on the VM instance's OCI security group, and the instance's iptables and ufw rules. I used "curl -v https://site > /dev/null" to look for any issues, and checked the Nginx logs to make sure that it was seeing my requests. I also checked the application logs to see if it was getting any requests from Nginx.

In the end, I needed to update an iptables rule for port 443 and make sure the iptables service was started. I also later had to go back and adjust the Nginx configuration, since Jupyterhub make a lot of use of web sockets, which weren't working.

## TCP Handshake

> What is the TCP 3-way handshake?

1. A client sends a SYN with its sequence number set to a random number. 
2. The server responds with a SYN-ACK, with its acknowledgement number set to the random number (plus one), in addition to setting the sequence number a shiny new random number.
3. The client sends an ACK back to the server with its acknowledgement number set to the initial random number (plus one), and its sequence number set to the new random number (plus one).

This initiates an active open, and signifies that the peers may now send TCP packets back and forth.

## TCP Uses

> Where is TCP in the OSI model? What kinds of application protocols is it best suited for? What protocols is it poorly suited for?

TCP is part of the Transport Layer in the OSI model.

TCP is the underlying protocol behind HTTP(S), since it's a great protocol to make sure that all data packets sent between nodes make it to their destination.

TCP is NOT a good protocol for setting up a VPN. This is because clients using a VPN will often already be using TCP to establish traffic that's being routed through the VPN. If a VPN wraps TCP traffic in another TCP connection, any packets that get dropped will be resent by BOTH the client and the VPN. This amplification of traffic can result in a degradation in a VPN's network performance and is referred to as TCP Meltdown.

## TCP vs UDP

> What are the differences, at a protocol level, between UDP and TCP?

When a client sends a TCP packet, it enumerates the packet identifying which packet it is in the sequence of packets its sending. The client keeps track of those numbers so it knows all of the packets its sent. The client will eventually start receiving responses from its peer stating that the peer received certain packets, which the client will correlate with the info it saved on the packets it sent. If the client finds that the peer has had adequate time to acknowledge that it received a packet, but hasn't yet, it will start re-sending packets to the peer.

When a client sends a UDP packet, it sends it and forgets about it.
