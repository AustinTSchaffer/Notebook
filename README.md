# Docker Certification

Resources and Demos that were used or created while working on a Docker Certification.

## Notice

I have not yet completed this certification. I have also put this certification
on the back-burner. As a result, the materials in this repository are incomplete
and do not sufficiently cover all of the requirements of the certification.

Before deciding whether or not to pursue a DCA, please note that the DCA covers
Docker Enterprise Edition (EE), which has more features than Docker Community
Edition (CE). I have stopped working on this certification, because I do not
have access to Docker-EE. Also, I do not feel that a deep knowledge of Docker-EE
will assist me in my day-to-day dealings with Docker-CE.

I still consider Docker to be a valuable tool for learning and applying
containerization, but that does not mean that you should strive for a DCA when
looking to learn about containerization.

Good luck out there.

## Help

If you are having touble running any of these demos, make sure you have root
permissions. You may also want to check the output of your docker version
against the version that I was using.

```bash
sudo docker version | diff resources/docker-version* -
```
