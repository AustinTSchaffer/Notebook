# OMSCS Orientation Doc

- As a Georgia Tech student, you are responsible for knowing these academic policies and information:
	- [Academic Catalog](https://catalog.gatech.edu/)
	- [Academic Honor Code](https://policylibrary.gatech.edu/student-affairs/academic-honor-code)
	- [Student/Faculty Expectations](https://catalog.gatech.edu/rules/22/)
	- [Expectations of Advisors and Advisees](https://catalog.gatech.edu/academics/graduate/expectations/)
- The foundational course requirement is a min grade of "B" in 2 foundational courses, within the first 3 semesters. You don't get an extension on this if you withdraw nor if you get a "C" or lower in a foundational course.
- https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/master-science-computer-science
- GPA
	- Students must earn at least a “B” in all courses in their chosen “Area of Specialization”.
	- Students must earn at least a “C” in all courses counting toward their “free” elective requirement.
	- Students must have a minimum overall GPA of 3.0 to graduate.
- Students must complete the degree in **six years**.
- Registration
	- I will be able to view my first time ticket on Friday, August 12, 2022 at 6:00pm ET.
	- Registration begins on Monday, August 15 and ends on Friday, August 26 at 4:00pm ET.
- OMSCS courses typically have a section formatted `O\d\d`, such as `O01`, `O02`, `O03`, etc. OAN is "OMS Analytics". OCY is "OMS Cybersecurity".
- Course materials will be available through Canvas sometime during the first week of classes. Canvas should be the first place you check once you have registered for a course.
- If you waitlist for a course, you'll get a notification that you need to act on within 12 hours.
- Dropping and Withdrawing
	- Add/Drop period extends 1 week into the semester
	- After the A/D period, dropping a course means you need to withdraw. Ws don't count toward or against GPA. You'll be able to take the course again.
	- Withdrawing from all courses in a semester means you're eligible for a pro-rated refund.
- Pages 9 and 10 of the PDF contain the semester schedule.
- Will my accounts be disabled if I travel to a different country while enrolled in OMSCS courses?
	- We are not sure if there is a way to prevent this from happening, but we strongly recommend that you contact the Technology Services Organization (TSO) (https://support.cc.gatech.edu/) for assistance if you encounter this. You also may need to contact the Office of Information Technology (OIT) (https://oit.gatech.edu/).
- If you get a C or below on a course, you can still retake it and try to get a B or higher. Both grades will count toward your GPA. You can substitute one grade once, where the first grade won't count toward GPA.
- If you want to take a semester off, you need to apply for a "Leave of Absence"
- You need to apply for graduation, during the semester before your "final" semester. You can still take courses after graduating, but you need to tell your academic advisor. HOWEVER you'll have a later time ticket window compared to degree-seeking students. Doesn't really look like you can get a double specialization.
- This document gets updated every year. Keep up with it.
