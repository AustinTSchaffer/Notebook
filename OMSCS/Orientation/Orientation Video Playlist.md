# Orientation Video Playlist
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl2dezBNo_Bme8RliCeBnjeK5_KnElfNU

This playlist does NOT replace the 40 page orientation document. I still need to read that too before August 22, 2022. This is meant to reinforce the most important points. This video playlist primarily covers:

- Tools that students will use
- Services available to students
- Suggestions meant to ensure we're successful

## Expectations
- This is a difficult program, it's intended to be much more difficult than a "MUC". The courses that are offered through this program are the same courses that are offered in the on-campus program.
- Open ended work. Real grades. It's a real graduate program. 
- 10-20 hours of work per week per course.
- Designed for working professionals, so extended timelines and due dates
- Generally won't be asked to attend live lectures. Office hours are optional.
- Course material is generally timed. You get access to material week by week depending on the course's progression. Assignments are opened and due at specific times. Courses have calendars.
- Grading is `[A, B, C, D, F]`. No pluses or minuses. Only the letter grade is reflected on transcripts.
- We're expected to use our GATech email addresses for all email communication. Instructors are not allowed to send email addresses to other domains (for the purposes of these courses), data privacy reasons. Check it daily.
- Read the orientation document. Not important to have encyclopedic knowledge of this document, but you're expected to read it.
- Don't cheat. Don't plagiarize.
- Read misconduct policies for each course.
- Cite sources.
- Follow exam guidelines.
- Start slow, one course per semester at first. Get off to a good start before trying out 2 courses per semester.
- Things come up, communicate with your professors and/or TAs if and when life happens. You're always allowed to withdraw from a course. You can skip semesters, but not 2 in a row unless you're prepared to apply for a leave of absence or apply for readmission.

## Registration
There's a lot of registration info in the orientation doc. Just go read it.

**Time Tickets:** Time tickets tell you when you're allowed to start registering. They open in 15 minute windows. The more classes you've completed, the earlier you can register. This guarantees that you get higher priority as you move up in the program, as long as you register within 15 minutes of your time ticket window. Registration takes 1 minute if you're prepared.

**Choosing Classes:** Check the current courses page for info on which courses you can/should take. Course videos and past syllabi are all online.

## OSCAR
- https://oscar.gatech.edu
- This is the online app where you
	- actually register for courses
	- see your grades
	- withdraw from classes
	- apply for graduation
- **O**nline **S**tudent **C**omputer **A**ssisted **R**egistration
- First login, PIN is birthday.
- Time ticket is viewable in this system
- How to search
	- Advanced search
	- Select "computational science and engineering" and "computer science"
	- Select "Online" for the campus
- Similar to registration at CNU, it'd be helpful to get the Course Registration Number (CRN) for the courses you're interesting in taking **before** you need to register. These are typically 5 digit numbers.
- OMG wait, it's the same system that CNU uses.
- You can join the waitlist for full classes

## Registration Tips
It's literally the same shit show as CNU's system. Good luck. Choose some backup options. Don't be afraid of wait lists.

## Passport
- https://passport.gatech.edu
- Main account management portal
- Change password
- Set up email alias
- Modify nickname
- Set emergency contact info
- Password expires every 4 months

## Canvas
- GATech uses Canvas as their Learning Management System (LMS)
- This is where course materials are available, assignments are submitted, and exams/quizzes are proctored/completed.
- Course videos are posted here.
- Recommended that you watch videos on their separate pages instead of going into playlist mode. Non-video content is usually injected between videos.
- Come to canvas immediately after registering (or when the semester starts, idk).

## Piazza (P-aht-za)
- https://piazza.com
- It's a higher-education internet forum.
- You can post anonymously (ruh-roh).
- You can post privately.
- You can post polls.
- Facilitates casual interaction.
- Helps with the isolation of online course programs.
- Don't spend too much time here, but definitely spend _some_ time here.
- There's probably going to be a lot of god info buried in here related to services and tools that other students are using both in coursework and their profession.

## Student Services and Tools
- [Current course listing](https://omscs.gatech.edu/current-courses)
