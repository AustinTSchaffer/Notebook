## Advising

From the initial orientation email:

> OMSCS Advising Email Address: [oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu](mailto:oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu)
> 1. OMSCS students should send a message to [oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu](mailto:oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu) from their GT email accounts when they have advising-related questions.
> 2. Please include your full name and nine-digit GT ID number (90X-XX-XXXX) in **EVERY** email, replacing the first two digits with “xx”. 
> 3. Please do not copy multiple people and/or send the same email to multiple people.  When you email [oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu](mailto:oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu), you will receive a ticket number.  This is your confirmation that we have received your message.
> 4. Please note that when we respond to your email, you will receive two emails:  one with our response and the other stating that your ticket has been resolved.  You should receive our response first; however, if you receive the "resolved ticket" message first, please be patient, as the response email should arrive soon.  Please check to ensure it did not go to another folder (like spam) before emailing us to say that you did not receive a response.  Your patience with this is greatly appreciated.
> 5. If you have further questions after we answer your email (close your ticket), you **MUST** open a new ticket by sending a new, separate email to [oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu](mailto:oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu) (including your full name and nine-digit GT ID number).  If you reply to our response, there is a good chance you will not receive a reply because these messages are not always directed back to the [oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu](mailto:oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu) account.  To ensure your email is received, please send a new email every time you have a question.

## FALL 2022 Phase II Registration

From the initial orientation email:

> Please refer to the [academic calendar](https://registrar.gatech.edu/calendar) for important dates pertaining to Fall 2022 Phase II registration.
>
> As you prepare for Phase II registration, you will notice that our most popular OMSCS courses currently are full and have a wait list.  These courses are in high demand each semester, so it most likely will not be possible for newly-admitted students to enroll in them during their first term.  We will typically email an update noting if we have determined that a certain class will not grow any further, so we encourage you to watch for these announcements throughout the registration period.
>
> There are no official prerequisites for the OMSCS courses, so new students are able to enroll in any of the available foundational courses (denoted with an asterisk (*) online at [https://omscs.gatech.edu/current-courses](https://omscs.gatech.edu/current-courses)).  We encourage you to review the “Current Courses” page, as you will find detailed descriptions of each of our courses as you are making your selections for the upcoming semester.
>
> Overall, please try to be flexible with the order in which you plan to take your courses, especially with your first semester in the OMSCS program.  Keep in mind that you must complete ten courses to complete your degree, so there will be opportunities to take many different courses in future semesters.
