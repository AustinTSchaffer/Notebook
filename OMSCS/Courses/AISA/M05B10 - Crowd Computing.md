## Crowdsourcing Architecture
- consumers
	- providing problems to be solved by crowd
	- generating human intelligence tasks
- contributors (crowd)
- service providers
	- how many workers does a HIT need?
	- how to integrate crowd contributions to meet the consumer's requirements?
	- How to create incentives while lower the cost to make it a profitable business model.

Framework
1. answer integration
2. task assignment
3. database of crowd sourced data

Microwork
- series of small tasks which together comprise a large unified project
- competed by many people over the internet
- considered the smallest unit of work in a virtual assembly line
- it is often used where human intelligence is required to complete the task efficiently

Classification of HITs
- Format of questions
- Nature of answers
- two dimensions
	- binary choice? multiple choice? open?
	- answers have ground truth? don't have ground truth?

	- Jokes
	- Poems
	- Sportsball players
	- recipes
	- hiking trails

## Potential Project Ideas
P2P Crowd Counting
- crowd-based fake news detection
- crowd-based state/mood detection
- crowd based video/image/item tagging

Decentralized P2P Crowd Selection
- crowd based recommendation by similarity
- crowd based video/image/text/item tagging

- Something involving these new GPT text models
- Something involving the library of babel?
- Something involving test case fuzzing

## Elements or a Wise Crowd
