# Course Review
- The lectures could/should discuss technologies that were invented < 20 years ago.
	- Chord? Last update of Chord was in 2013 and
	- Lecture notes refer to Pastry, "a substrate for peer-to-peer applications". The last release of this software was in 2009. It used Java 5. Current version of Java is Java 19. Even the framework that this software depends on was EOL over a decade ago.
	- CAN, Chord, and Pastry could be used as history lessons, with brief overviews of how the DHT, content IDing, node IDing, and routing worked, instead of making them the central points of the lectures.
	- The latest in P2P file sharing is IPFS.
- There's no space given to ethical considerations, lectures only talk about the technologies as if the application of the technologies are pure and good and academic. We discussed P2P networks through the lens of music "sharing". The lectures could at least talk about sharing knowledge, like research papers, instead of focusing on the use case of subverting copyright law.
