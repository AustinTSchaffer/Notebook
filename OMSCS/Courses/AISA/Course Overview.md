- Establish a foundation for in-depth study on contained topics

## Questions Covered?
- How to build scalable web services?
- What kinds of system support do we need?
- What are new techniques that will help develop fast, scalable, and high available internet applications?
- How can traditional system issues help?

## Mechanisms of Learning
- Lectures
- Q&A sessions
- homework assignments
	- programming or
	- reading critique
- course project (group or individual)
- technology review

## Programming Assignment
Each programming assignment is related to the course content covered in the current or previous module.

Each programming assignment is given
- at least 2 programming problems, each with multiple options
- you are asked to choose one option of one problem as your homework

Each programming assignment should have
- problem
- dataset
- code required
- experiments required
- summary/discussion report
