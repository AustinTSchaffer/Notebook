# M12B24 - RFID and RFID Sensing

- RFID = Radio Frequency Identification
- Rag memory can be factory or field programmed, partitionable, and optionally permanently locked
- Bytes left unlocked can be rewritten 100k times
- Effectively a "next-generation barcode" where line of sight is not required

RFID also refers to
- using RF waves to transfer data between a reader and a tagged movable item to ID, categorize, track, etc
- RFID is fast, reliable, and does not require physical sight or contact between reader/scanner and the tagged item

- Each tag has a unique ID
- Anyone can read the ID through radio connection

**Characteristics**
- passive device, receives power from reader
- range up to several meters
- "smart label", simply calls out its unique name and/or static data

**Little memory**
- static 64-to-128 bit identifier in current ultra-cheap generation (5c / unit)
- Advancing to hundreds of bits
- Maybe writeable under good conditions

**Little computational power**
- few thousand logic gates
- static keys for read/write permission
- no real cryptographic functions available

## RFID Tags
- can be attached to any physical object

### Variations
- Size: 16bits to 512kB or more
- Read only, write/read, WORM
- Type: EEProm, Antifuse, FeRam
- Arbitration (Anti-collision)
	- ability to read/write one or many tags at a time
- Frequency
	- 125kHz - 5.8GHz
- Physical size
	- Thumbnail to Brick
- Price
	- $0.50 to $250

**Basic types**
- Active
	- tag transmits radio signal
	- battery powered memory, radio, and circuitry
	- high read range (300 feet)
- Passive
	- Tag reflects radio signal from reader
	- reader powered
	- shorter read range (4 inches - 15 feet)
- Semi-passive / hybrid

**Battery of Active Tags**
- last 3-5 years
- Some are motion/event activated
- 802.11 Versions
- Real time location services (using WLAN access points (APs))

## Passive RFID Tags
- small
- Cheap
- Durable
- Short read range
- Not self-powered
- essentially a 0-visibility barcode

**Types**
- Read Only (Class 0)
- Read/Write (Class 1)
	- WORM (Write Once Read Many)
	- Ability to write to an RFID device outside of the RFID manufacturer's facility after manufacturing
	- information can be read from or written to an RFID transponder during the time it is presented to a reader/writer

### RFID Tags at many frequencies

## RFID Readers
Primary functions
- remotely power tags
- establish a bidirectional data link
- inventory tags, filter results
- communicate with networked server(s)
- inform the user of the reader what the hell is going on, if hand-held (optional)

## RFID Systems
RFID systems have 3 main components
- the reader
- the tag
- the host with its own hardware, functions, and predefined tasks

![[Pasted image 20230410140304.png]]

Sequence of communications
- host manages reader(s) and issues commands
- reader and tag communicate via RF signal
- Carrier signal generated by the reader (upon request from the host app)
- carrier signal sent out through the antennas
- tag receives and modifies carrier signal
	- "sends back" modulated signal (passive backscatter - FCC and ITU refer to this as a "field disturbance device")
- Antennas receive the modulated signal and send them back to the reader
- the reader decodes the data
- Results returned to the host application

## Constraints and Challenges
![[Pasted image 20230410152510.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230410152601.png]]

## Enhancing RFID Privacy
- leakage of personal belongings data
- lead data regarding belongings without awareness of the user

### Approach 1: Minimalist Cryptography
- key observation: adversary must have physical proximity to tag and interact with it
- key assumption: adversary can query tag only limited number of times in any given attach session

![[Pasted image 20230410152734.png]]

Pseudorandom Rotation
- set of pseudonyms known only by trusted verifier
- pseudonyms stored on tag
- tag cycles through pseudonyms

### Approach 2: The "Blocker" Tag
- Blocker simulates all possible tag serial numbers
- Should protect privacy, but still avoid blocking unpurchased items

Blocker tag can be selective
- Privacy zones: only block certain ranges of RFID-tag serial numbers
- Zone mobility: allow shops to move items into privacy zone upon purchase

Example:
- tags might carry a "privacy bit"
- blocker blocks all identifiers with privacy bit on
- items in supermarket have privacy bit off
- on checkout, leading bit is flipped from off to on
	- PIN required, as for "kill" operation

### Approach 3: Personal Simulator or Proxy for RFID
Example: Nokia mobile-phone RFID kit
- readers will be compact, available in personal devices

We might imagine a simulation lifecycle
- mobile phone "acquires" tag when in proximity
- mobile phone simulates tags to readers, enforcing user privacy policy
- mobile phone "releases" tags when tags are about to exit range

Formal security requirements
- indistinguishability
- forward security

## Internet of Things
- IoT envisions billions of sensors to be connected to the internet
- put computers in everything and give everything a network connection
- TODO: add security here

IoT Layers
- Sensing and Identification
- Network Construction
- Information Processing
- Integrated Application
