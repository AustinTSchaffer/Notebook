# M13B26 - Big Data as a Service (BDaaS)

- rethinking of how the software defined intelligence should be learned, implemented, and delivered
- case studies
	- discrete optimization problems

Discrete optimization problems. Finding top `k`...
- ...most influential people in a large social network
- ...most interesting blogs from a sea of blogs
- ...best matches of keyword search
- ...locations to place sensors to gain the best coverage

Social influence analysis
- how to discover the most influential people for marketing of a product / idea / innovation on a social network?
- Want max effect of advertisement with limited marketing budget

Sensor placements
- maximize information coverage with budget constraints
- maximize information coverage at minimum communication cost
- Where should we place sensors to quickly detect freshwater contamination?
	- Water sensors are expensive and only be placed in limited locations on the network
	- Want to get the most useful information at the lowest cost

## Big Data Enabled Machine Intelligence
![[Pasted image 20230411184209.png]]

- Supervised Learning: classifying new data from known properties
- Unsupervised Learning: discovering hidden properties of data
- Reinforcement Learning: make the best decisions by feedback driven learning to maximize long-term reward
