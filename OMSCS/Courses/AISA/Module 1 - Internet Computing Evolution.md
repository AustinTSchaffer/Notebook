# Module 1 - Internet Computing Evolution

What is the internet?
- publicly available global network of computers
- provides a common communication system for diverse computing and network environments
- Uses TCP/IP protocols and packet switching
- runs on any communications substrate

History
- Created in 1983 (ARPANet, 1969)
- end-to-end architecture

## Internet-scale computing: Delivering disruptive technologies

- Web Search, Web Services exemplified by search engines <-- Physical library and bookstores, tourist office, doctor office
- Search over Deep Web + Semantic Web, Online News <-- Radio, Newspapers, bookstores
- Voice over IP + instant messaging + video conferencing <-- long distance phone calls, travel for meetings
- Internet Movies + Internet Music <-- Movie theaters, movie rental stores
- PayPal, AliPay, ApplePay, WebChat Pay <-- banks, credit unions (credit cards remain important)
- Social Networks, Online Communities, 24/7 ubiquitous internet connectivity <-- post office, long distance telephone services, taxi, hotel

## Continuous Evolution of Internet Systems
Internet today
- It's everywhere
- connects people to information
- connects people to other people
- connects between physical objects (IoT)

Future internet
- industrial automation
- smart health
- smart home
- smart city

More things are being connected
- home / daily life devices
- business and public infra
- health-care
- smart buildings
- smart cars and vehicles

Internet Revolution Phases
- Internet of Boffins (1969 - 1995)
- Internet of Geeks (1995 - 2000)
- Internet of Masses (2000 - 2007)
- Mobile Internet (2007 - 2011)
- Internet of Things (2012 -> ???)

Sensors are becoming widely available

## Future Internet Applications

### Scenario: Smart Shopping
- Goods will introduce and market themselves
- Scanners will identify tags on customer clothing
- When paying for goods, payment method will communicate with the checkout reader
- when moving goods, reading will inform the staff to restock the items
- eye tracking technology to see what customers are looking at

### Scenario: Smart Home
- remote monitor for smart houses
- remote control for smart appliances

### Scenario: Health Care Innovation
- National Health Information Network
- Electronic Patient Reconds
- Telemedicine
- Home care monitoring and control
	- pulse ox
	- blood
	- glucose monitors
	- infusion pumps
	- accelerometers
- operating room of the future
	- closed loop monitoring and control
	- multiple treatment stations
	- plug and play devices
	- robotic microsurgery
- progress in bioinformatics
	- gene / protein expression
	- systems biology
	- disease dynamics
	- control mechanisms

### Scenario: Smart Transportation
- network of sensors set up throughout vehicle can interact with its surroundings to provide valuable feedback on traffic conditions
- Condition and event detection sensors
- Maintain driver and passenger comfort and safety
- Airbags and seatbelt pre-tensioning
- Sensors for fatigue and mood monitoring, based on driving conditions, driver behavior and facial indicators

> Yo, what about busses and trains?

### Scenario: Smart Agriculture
- Monitoring
- Drones

### Scenario: Environmental Monitoring
- Natural disaster prediction and monitoring
- Logistics
	- Warehouse management
	- port management
	- weather-condition supply-chain management

### Scenario: Smart Food
- Control geographical origin
- Nutrition calculation
- prevent overproduction and shortage
- control quality, health, safety

## Future Internet Challenges
- Should respect original principles
	- serve the many, not the few
	- local variation, cultural differences
- Controlled by people, not monolithic entities
	- democratic accountability
	- legal framework for regulation
- part of the real world, not a pure virtual space
	- seamless integration between physical and cyber
	- overcome the myth of "cyberspace"
- internet embodies liberal values
	- all nodes visible
	- peering and routing
	- no authentication or approval required
- Today's internet is not culturally neutral
	- social, political, scientific influences on the internet

> Don't forget about privacy, security, and ethics.
