# 00 - Welcome! (Course Overview)

- Deep dive into the world of AI and Ethics
- Explore methods to mitigate the impact of algorithms
- Abuse of big data means your worst fears can come true
- Focus on the effects of big data on individuals, organizations, and society

## Course Structure
- **_Module 1 - Data, Individuals, and Society_ -** Understand the power and impact that analytics and AI/ML have on individuals and society, especially concerning issues such as fairness and bias, ethics, legality, data collection and public use.
- **_Module 2 – The BS of Big Data & Stats 101_ -** Understand the underlying components of big data, apply basic statistical techniques to data scenarios, and understand the issues faced when learning from big data, ranging from data biases, causation vs correlation, etc.
- **_Module 3 – AI/ML Techniques_ -** Understand and apply basic AI/ML techniques to data scenarios, with a focus on instituting “fair” practices when designing decision-making systems based on big data.
- _**Module 4 - Bias Mitigation Applications**_ **–** Apply your knowledge of analytics and AI/ML to transform a current biased data-set into a more objective solution.

## Code of Conduct
- This issue of data misuse and abuse is not easily solvable; concrete right or wrong answers are not easily determined until after solutions are typically deployed into society.
- Everyone is to be respected for their opinions on any topics presented throughout the course, whatever they happen to be.
- However, you must be able to support your viewpoints and solutions effectively, i.e. showing that you have thought about the problem, can discuss its various trade-offs and implications, and can be supportive of other viewpoints, even though your personal views may be different.
- There is no math snobbery in this class
    - Technical work is to be grounded in understanding social context
    - An approach is not to be justified solely by the math it entails
    - Understand that social science can also be rigorous
