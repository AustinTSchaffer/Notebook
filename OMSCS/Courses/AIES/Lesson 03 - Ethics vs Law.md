# Lesson 03 - Ethics vs Law

## Relationship between Ethics and Law
- Provide a framework to evaluate what is right and what is wrong
- Law
	- System of rules of conduct established by the government to maintain stability and justice
	- Defines the legal rights and duties of the people and provides the means of enforcing these rights and duties
	- Laws carry sanctions of a governing authority
- Ethics
	- Set of moral principles
	- Rules about the kinds of actions are morally right or wrong, as well as the values placed on what is morally good/bad
	- No penalties for violators
- A relationship exists between law and ethics. In some instances, law and ethics overlap (related) and what is supposed as unethical is also illegal.
- In other situations, they do not overlap. In some cases, what is supposed as unethical is still legal, and in others, what is illegal is perceived as ethical.
- Ethics and law sometimes conflict.

**Equality of Opportunity**: Ensuring that decision making processes treat similar people similarly on the basis of relevant features, given their current degree of similarity.

**Equality of Outcome**: Forces decision-making to treat seemingly dissimilar people similarly, on the belief that their current dissimilarity is the result of past injustices.

## Ethical Decision Making
- **Dilemma** occurs when a decision that could benefit a person/org might also cause harm to others.
- One way of thinking is to understand **vital life interests** vs **quality-of-life interests**.
- Cultural differences also create difficulty.

## Code of Ethics
Professional boards and orgs have written "ethics codes" which hold members to a higher standard than the law imposes.

Violations can lead to revocation of license, suspension of rights to practice, censure, or loss of privilege.

### Consequence-Based Ethics
- Priority is given to choices that lead to a good outcome
- The outcome outweighs the method
- **Utilitarian View** - The "right choice" delivers the greatest good to the most people.
- **Individualism View** - the "right choice" is the best for long-term self-interest.

### Rule-Based Ethics
- Priority is given to following the rules without undue regard to the outcome
- Rules are often thought to codify principles like truthfulness, right to freedom, justice, etc
- **Moral-Rights View** - the "right choice" is that which respects fundamental rights shared by all humans
- **Rule-Based/Justice View** - the "right choice" is that which is impartial, fair, and equitable in treating people; exists for the benefit of society and should be followed.
