What might be wrong here?
- Is the ratio of deaths to people (88/3) accurate? How was that stat sampled?
- Are the bills of mortality comprehensive?

If we want to analyze the change in the interest level of HS students that might be interested in computing

- population: all HS students in the US
- Sample was response from HS seniors in a high-income area in Georgia over the last 10 years

If we were to claim that our results were representative of:
- All HS students
- All HS seniors
- All HS seniors in the US
- All HS seniors in Georgia

**This would be a Biased Sampling.** The results of this analysis could be used to mislead the general public.

## How to mislead through poor analysis
Data analysis is a process of gathering, modeling, and transforming data with the goal of highlighting useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision making.

## How to Mislead through interpretation
- interpreting data often involves displaying it in some useful way
