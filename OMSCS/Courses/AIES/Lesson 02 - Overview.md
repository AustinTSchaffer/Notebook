# Lesson 02 - Overview

## Targeted Messaging
- Scroll a social media feed.
	- How many posts are sponsored?
	- How often?
- Companies have to identify users and gauge their interests so they can target the ads to those individuals.
- Google Analytics
	- Anyone can target an audience for advertisements with very little money.
- How unique are you?
	- https://aboutmyinfo.org
- Pretty much everyone knows your IP address
	- IP addresses can be traced to a zip code
- Big data allows orgs to target specific demographics
- This type of marketing what not possible 20 years ago
- Big data also allows organizations to do a lot more than targeted advertising

## What's the Problem?
- Humans are biased
- garbage in -> garbage out
- ergo, AI/ML systems are as biased as the data they were trained on. The decisions they make are rarely unbiased.

- Physiognomy: The practice of using people's outer appearance to infer innter character. In p. there is the belief that there are inferior "types" of people, identifiable by their facial features and body measurements.
- In 1876: Cesare Lombroso measured a bunch of traits of people who had committed crimes. Obviously bunk science.

> Algorithms do not predict the future. Algorithms create a model of decisions made in the past. "Past performance is indicative of future behavior," but situations change.
