# Lesson 04 - Data Collection

##  Facebook Cambridge Analytica Scandal
- Prime example of data management going wrong
- Data management is SUPER important
- Who actually owns and controls access to data?
- "seminole moment" in our understanding of personal data and ownership
- resulted in tighter regulations

- Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained data on as many as 50 million people.
- CA is a data-mining firm.
- In total violation of FB's rules, CA didn't tell anyone they were collecting the data
	- CA didn't inform users that they were collecting data
	- FB told CA to delete the data they collected
	- CA never did
	- FB didn't follow up
	- FB didn't inform users that data was improperly used
- FB now has tighter restrictions with their FB developers

## Information Privacy
- What is data privacy? Relationship between collection and dissemination of data, tech, the public expectation of privacy, legal and political issues surrounding them
- The ability to collect info on individuals, combine facts from separate data sources, and merge this data with other non-personal types of information has resulted in archives of information that were previously unimaginable
- This aggregation also permits organizations to build databases of facts

**Legislation**
- Financial Services Modernization Act (AKA the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999)
	- Regulates financials orgs
	- Ensures that org's privacy policies are fully disclosed
- Federal Privacy Act of 1974
	- Regulates the govt
- Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986
	- Regulates the interception of wire, electronic, etc
- Common Carrier Regulation
	- Any proprietary info shall be used explicitly for providing services, and not for any marketing purposes
	- Stipulates that carriers cannot disclose this information except when necessary to provide their service
- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)
	- Restricts the dissemination and distribution of private health information by organizations without documented consent.
	- Provides patients the right to know who has access to their info and who has accessed it
	- Unclear how HIPAA applies to wearable devices

## Intellectual Property Rights and Protections
- Intellectual Property (IP) rights are the rights given to persons over the creations of their minds. They usually give the creator an exclusive right over the use of his/her creation for a certain period of time.
- When you create information, you typically acquire the rights to that information.
- Thus, unauthorized replication and/or re-use of your information would be a breach of your IP rights!

Not so fast, did you even read the terms and conditions?
