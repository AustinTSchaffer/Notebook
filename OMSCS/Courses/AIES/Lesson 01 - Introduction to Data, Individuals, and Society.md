# Lesson 01 - Introduction to Data, Individuals, and Society

- Learning Objective: power and impact that AI, analytics, and ML have on individuals and society
	- Privacy
	- Legality
	- Ethics
- Be able to argue for and against the impacts of deploying AI in our society

## China's Social Credit System
- Jaywalking
- Running late on bills
- Running a red light

Seems dystopian and otherworldly but the US also has similar systems in place
- Airports
- Schools
- Border crossings

### Possible unethical uses of big data
- filtering job applicants, college applicants
- approving applications for loans, credit cards
- predicting risk levels for insurance
- user profiling for policing
- predict recidivism risk
- identifying risk of developing mental health problems

### Goals
 - How do we design algorithms that deal with large amounts of data, while assuring that the results are not misused?
 - We will examine various AI/ML techniques that can be used to counterbalance the potential abuse and misuse of learning from big data, with a focus on the impacts of these technologies on society.
