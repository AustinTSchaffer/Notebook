# Final Project

## TODO
- [ ] Need to find a dataset
	- Sources
		- any dataset from the machine learning repository - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets
		- any dataset from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets,
		- any dataset openly provided by an organization, preferably non-profit, that could benefit from this analysis
	- Restrictions
		- Must have a sample size of at least 500 observations
		- Must have at least two variables belonging to a legally recognized protected class
		- Must have at least two dependent variables (outcome variables) that could result in favorable or unfavorable outcomes (this can be subjective)
			- Note: We can derive a new dependent variable if it comes directly using inputs from the dataset itself - i.e., it can't be imaginary data.
		- Must be related to one of the regulated domains: Credit, Education, Employment, or "Housing and Public Accommodation"
			- Loosely, any dataset that could have potential bias in outcomes based on 2 protected class membership is acceptable.
			- Also, don’t be biased by how the dataset is labeled/organized – you can think creatively about how to structure the dataset so it’s compliant to the requirements
	- Questions
		- Which dataset did you select?
		- Which regulated domain does your dataset belong to?
		- How many observations are in the dataset?
		- How many variables are in the dataset?
		- Which variables did you select as your dependent variables?
		- How many and which variables in the dataset are associated with a legally recognized protected class? Which legal precedence/law (as discussed in the lectures) does each protected class fall under?
- [ ] Need to identify collaboration platform
	- should only contain a single notebook and a single report
	- Deliverable must be Python (no R or Julia allowed)
	- For notebook collab, need to identify a notebook collaboration platform
	- For report collab, Google Docs?
- [ ] Assignment Submissions notes
	- If you are working on the project as a team, only one person needs to submit this assignment.
	- If you choose to work in a group, there is one additional set of questions for the team provided at the end.
	- During submission of the final project in canvas, all students are required to include in the comments section their team members. 
		- To type in the comments section in canvas, you may either create a file (*.Doc or *.PDF) with a list of members (as an attachment file)
		- or directly add team members in the comments section.
	- The `.ipynb` must be submitted having been run to completion, containing all output and showing graphs.
