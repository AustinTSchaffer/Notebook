## Why Should You Take This Course

- Implied prerequisite for Advanced Operating Systems (AOS).
- This course is designed for
	- students who aren't familiar with advanced topics regarding the internals of operating systems
	- students who haven't seen those topics for a while

After this course, you should be able to answer all diagnostics questions for AOS.

## Course Overview

Learning goals
- What are OSes?
- Why do we need them?
- How are they designed and implemented?

Topics: OS abstractions, mechanisms, and policies
- processes and process mgmt
- threads and concurrency
- resource management
- communication and I/O
- OS support for distributed services
- systems software that's used in data centers and cloud environments

## Theory and Practice

Sequence of programming projects:
- threads, concurrency, and synchronization
- single-node OS mechanisms
	- interprocess-comms, scheduling
- multi-node OS mechanisms
	- including gRPC
- experimented design and evaluation. Inside into the behavior of OSes

Projects require programming in C in a Linux environment.
