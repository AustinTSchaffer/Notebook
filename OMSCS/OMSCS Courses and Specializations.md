- Notes that [it's possible to take more than 10 courses](https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/bl2rmo/taking_more_than_10_courses_selecting_credits/), so I don't have to stop at 10. You need to let your advisor know.

## [Computing Systems Specialization](https://omscs.gatech.edu/specialization-computing-systems)

I am currently looking at the "**Computing Systems**" specialization, which covers topics such as distributed systems, networking, security, and high-performance computing. This specialization interests me because it would be directly relevant to my current career trajectory and goals, so the skills would be immediately useful.

- Core Courses. You need to pick pick at least 3. Any Core Courses in excess of the 9 hour (3 course) requirement may be counted toward the electives requirement.
	- [ ] [CS 6515 Introduction to Graduate Algorithms](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6515-intro-graduate-algorithms)
		- This one is required, non negotiable. There is also CS 6505, but it's not currently being offered through OMSCS, it seems.
		- This one is also a core course for the Interactive Intelligence (`II`) specialization.
	- [ ] [CS 6400 Database Systems Concepts and Design](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6400-database-systems-concepts-and-design)
	- [ ] [CS 6250 Computer Networks](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6250-computer-networks)
	- [ ] [CS 6300 Software Development Process](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6300-software-development-process) (Also a core course for `II`)
- Electives I'm interested in taking. This is a subset of all the electives offered for this specialization, of which I'd need to select **at least 3**. I've ordered this shorter list of electives from most-most interested to least-most interested.
	- [ ] [CS 6675 Advanced Internet Computing Systems and Applications](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6675-advanced-internet-systems-and-applications)
	- [ ] [CS 7210 Distributed Computing](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7210-distributed-computing)
	- [ ] [CS 7280 Network Science](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7280-network-science) (Don't let the name throw you off, the description describes graph algorithm concepts)
	- [ ] [CS 6340 Software Analysis and Testing](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6340-software-analysis)
	- [ ] [CSE 6220 High-Performance Computing](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cse-6220-intro-hpc)
	- [ ] [CS 6200 Graduate Introduction to Operating Systems](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6200-introduction-operating-systems)
- The (at least 4) additional courses that I'd take to fill out the degree requirements would probably be selected from the following:
	- [ ] [CS 6601 Artificial Intelligence](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6601-artificial-intelligence)
	- [ ] [CS 7637 Knowledge-Based AI](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7637-knowledge-based-artificial-intelligence-cognitive-systems)
	- [ ] [CS 7641: Machine Learning](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7641-machine-learning)
	- [ ] [CS 7642: Reinforcement Learning](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7642-reinforcement-learning)
	- [ ] [CS 6475: Computational Photography](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6475-computational-photography)
	- [ ] [CS 6476: Computer Vision](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6476-computer-vision)
	- [ ] [CS 7632: Game AI](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7632-game-ai)

## [Interactive Intelligence Specialization](https://omscs.gatech.edu/specialization-interactive-intelligence)

My 2nd choice would be the **Interactive Intelligence** specialization. This specialization is not as relevant to my professional trajectory and goals, but the topics are just too interesting to ignore.

- Core Courses (at least 3)
	- [ ] [CS 6515 Introduction to Graduate Algorithms](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6515-intro-graduate-algorithms)
		- This one is required, non negotiable. There is also CS 6505, but it's not currently being offered through OMSCS, it seems.
		- This one is also a core course for the Computing Systems specialization.
	- [ ] [CS 6601 Artificial Intelligence](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6601-artificial-intelligence)
	- [ ] [CS 7637 Knowledge-Based AI](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7637-knowledge-based-artificial-intelligence-cognitive-systems)
	- [ ] [CS 7641 Machine Learning](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7641-machine-learning)
- Electives I'm interested in taking. This is a subset of all the electives offered for this specialization, of which I'd need to select **at least 2**. I've ordered this shorter list of electives from most-most interested to least-most interested. Turns out I;m really only interested in the Core courses for this specialization.
	- [ ] [CS 7632 Game AI](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7632-game-ai)
	- [ ] [CS 6440 Introduction to Health Informatics](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6440-intro-health-informatics)
- Please refer to the Computing Systems Specialization section for all other courses that I'll be using to complete this degree/specialization.
