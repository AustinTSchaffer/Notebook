# Images vs Containers

## Images

An image is a collection of resources that make up your program, on top of your
intended distribution platform or stack.

This includes the file system, base OS, pre-installed programs, libraries,
source code, and binaries, which all make up your program.

## Containers

A container is the running instance of an image. You can have multiple different
containers based on a single image.
