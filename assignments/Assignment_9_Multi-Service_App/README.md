# Create a MultiService App

- Docker's Distributed Voting App
- Use `swarm-app-1` from bretfischer repo
- 1 volume, 2 networks, 5 services
- Create the commands needed, spin up services, and test app
- Everything is using Docker Hub images, so no data needed on Swarm
- You don't want to be building images on your Swarm. THAT IS BAD.
- This assignment is 1/2 science, 1/2 art.
