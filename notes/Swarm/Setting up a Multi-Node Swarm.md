# Creating a 3-Node Swarm

Need to set up 3 different linux machines

1. play-with-docker.com
    1. Only needs a browser, but resets after 4 hours.
2. docker-machine + Virtualbox
    1. Hefty RAM usage
3. Digital Ocean + Docker install
    1. Most like a production setup, but costs $5-10/node/month while learning
4. Roll your own
    1. Docker-Machine can provision machines for Amazon, Azure, Digital Ocean, Google, etc.
    2. Use the get.docker.com script on any remote Linux box to get a Docker
       installation set up on any hosting provider.
