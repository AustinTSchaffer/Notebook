# Notes to Take

Some quick reminders of notes that I need to write on various topics.

* Continue with AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification [[00 - Certified Solutions Architect - Associate]]
* Airflow seems pretty cool: https://airflow.apache.org/
* Set up python script to generate markdown files that act as a table of contents for all of my notes files
    * Set up a Github pipeline to do this for me auto-magically
* Fireship
    * ["7 fancy programming words"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zc9ci9L5wY)
    * [7 features of the web that I probably don't know about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppwagkhrZJs)
    * [WASM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucmbO2lWC2A). Might be interesting to hear another take on WASM and maybe get some notes written on it.
    * [Typescript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQnBQ4tB3ZA)
    * [React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn6-PIqc4UM)
    * [Angular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn6-PIqc4UM)
    * [Web Sockets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BfCnjr_Vjg). Relate this note to the notes on transferring files from Android to Linux, since Snapdrop uses websockets to perform P2P file transfer.
    * [Nginx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKxlsvZXG7c6)
    * [Session vs Token Auth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBUNrFtufWo)
* Numbers and Stuff
    * Probably need a new section of notes for Fundamental Computer Science and Mathematics.
    * [Video on Quasiperfect Numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdgZQWZgEqs), if only for the part where Eric Lander talks about getting addicted to finding some seemingly insignificant part of mathematics that he was able to affect, thereby pushing the whole field forward. Thought that was an interesting take on finding a way to make a difference in a small way. Probably classify that quote somewhere under "Coding Project Ideas", rename the dir to "Project Ideas".
    * [Keepsack Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MacVqujSXWE), no idea if this video is at all relevant to anything I'm interested in. It's ok if I watch it once and drop it.
    * [Video on Fast Fourier Transform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7apO7q16V0). The video title calls it an algorithm, so yeah you've got me hooked.
* Architecture of the Internet
    * Networking is black magic, everyone knows this.
    * [Video on how Transport Layer Security works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TLDTodL7Lc)
    * [More TLS Knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86cQJ0MMses)
    * [DNS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOfonONtIuk)

* Clarity Coders
    * Clarity Coders makes good stuff. Generally good content, well paced.
    * [Introduction to PyTorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtmi-H-mlKw). The code for this should be under Daily Programmer, but I can take notes here.
    * [Python and OpenCV Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmThsnqUCF0)
