## Notes to Take

Some quick reminders of notes that I need to write on various topics.

- [Notes on this video describing TSP algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiDsjIBOVoA)
	- Implement described algorithms in Python
* Fireship
    * [7 features of the web that I probably don't know about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppwagkhrZJs)
    * [WASM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucmbO2lWC2A). Might be interesting to hear another take on WASM and maybe get some notes written on it.
    * [Web Sockets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BfCnjr_Vjg). Relate this note to the notes on transferring files from Android to Linux, since Snapdrop uses websockets to perform P2P file transfer.
* Numbers and Stuff
    * Probably need a new section of notes for Fundamental Computer Science and Mathematics.
    * [Keepsack Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MacVqujSXWE), no idea if this video is at all relevant to anything I'm interested in. It's ok if I watch it once and drop it.
    * [Video on Fast Fourier Transform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7apO7q16V0). The video title calls it an algorithm, so yeah you've got me hooked.
* Architecture of the Internet
    * Networking is black magic, everyone knows this.
    * [Video on how Transport Layer Security works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TLDTodL7Lc)
    * [More TLS Knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86cQJ0MMses)
    * [DNS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOfonONtIuk)
* Clarity Coders
    * Clarity Coders makes good stuff. Generally good content, well paced.
    * [Introduction to PyTorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtmi-H-mlKw). The code for this should be under Daily Programmer, but I can take notes here.
    * [Python and OpenCV Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmThsnqUCF0)
