# Compiling Federal Code

What if you could interpret the US Federal Code as a scripting language? Bonus points for including Federal Executive Departments.

- US Federal Code: https://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml
- FDA: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=152.126

Pull down a copy of all federal code in a text format and perform text operations on the federal code. Possibly try to interpret a legal chapter or 2 

At the least it'd be interesting to track changes in a git repo so it was easier to see a diff over time.
